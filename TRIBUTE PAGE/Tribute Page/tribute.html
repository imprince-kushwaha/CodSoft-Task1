      <h3>THE JALLIANWALA BAGH MASSACRE:-</h3><p>
        The Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 stands as one of the most horrifying incidents in India's history under British colonial rule. The callous actions of British troops, under the command of General Reginald Dyer, resulted in the brutal killing
         and injuring of hundreds of innocent civilians who had gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.The sight of unarmed men, women, and children being mercilessly fired upon by British troops left an everlasting scar on Bhagat Singh's heart. 
         The incident awakened a profound sense of injustice and a burning desire to see his nation free from the clutches of British tyranny.
